    paragraph:"Solar panels create a great return on investment in terms of energy output costs.Some may try to argue that installing solar panels is a costly initial investment, but they fail to realize the potential of energy savings down the road. The ROI you get from solar panels often exceeds that of other investments made into your business, especially if you have a large warehouse space. If you have multiple large warehouses, solar panels are a smart bet towards moving you into true energy independence."
